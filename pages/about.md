<h1 style= "padding-top: 64px; padding-bottom: 18px;">  About the Innovation Office</h1>

**We help the City of Austin develop the problem-solving capabilities it needs to adapt rapidly and meet the needs of the future.**

The Innovation Office opened in 2014, with a vision to explore and experiment with new solutions to Austin's complex problems. We work with other City departments to research, design, and prototype early-stage concepts and solutions that make progress toward Austin’s strategic goals. In addressing challenges, we start with the needs, behaviors, and experiences of our community, and continue through a process of questioning assumptions, engaging with empathy, stewarding divergent thought, reflecting, and learning.
