# About the Innovation Office

**We help the City of Austin develop the problem-solving capabilities it needs to adapt rapidly and meet the needs of the future.**

The Innovation Office opened in 2014, with a vision to explore and experiment with new solutions to Austin's complex problems. We work as an internal consultant with other City departments to research, design, and prototype early-stage concepts and solutions that make progress toward Austin’s strategic goals.
