The City of Austin Innovation Office is soliciting project ideas from all City employees within four of the City Manager’s signature project tracks, each of which reflects a key priority of the City of Austin:

- Best Managed: project ideas that enhance productivity, efficiencies and/or create savings
- Most Livable: project ideas that contribute to the realization of Imagine Austin goals
- Service with PRIDE: project ideas that improve the citizen’s customer experience
- Open Government: project ideas that enhance transparency, accountability, and civic participation, and promote use of open data


## Refine your idea

Project ideas will go through phases of a refinement process. Your initial entry will tell us a bit about which track you're applying, who the project idea will impact, and the stage of maturity of your idea. The first round of assessments will judge the merit of the idea based on alignment to track: judges will determine the level of alignment (High, Medium, or Low) of ideas to the city priority that you identified. The average assessment of all judges will be automatically calculated by the platform and will result in a ranking of ideas according to how well the panel of judges believe that each idea aligns with the identified City priority. The ideas with the most merit will be invited to participate in subsequent stages of the selection process.

If your project is selected to move to the next stage, you will be invited to add more detail to your project idea. What does your project need to get off the ground? During this stage, you will have the opportunity to receive advice from subject matter experts, be assigned a project mentor, and recruit others to be on your project team.


## Judging

We will assemble a panel of judges drawn from City Departments, the Community Technology and Telecommunications Commission, and the City Council’s Economic Opportunity Committee to evaluate project ideas.

## Project selection and prize package

Projects selected for the Idea Accelerator will receive:

- One-on-one time with the City Manager at the beginning, middle, and end of your project.
Funding. The City Manager has committed $50,000 toward the Innovation Fund and this money can be used to help clarify, refine, prototype and/or implement the idea, accounting for a variety of project related costs such as new equipment or contracting outside expertise. Allocation of these funds is determined on a project by project basis and the final dollar amount awarded will be determined after the top project ideas have been selected.
- [Consulting services](http://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation/consulting/) from the Office of Innovation to help get your projects off the ground.
